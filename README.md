# foodieKing_webapp
Developed a dynamic website for users to post meal appointment to attract others based on their real location. Restaurant holders can launch group-buy activity using restaurant management page. Users can join meal events launched by other users or group buy events hosted by restaurants and order online. Back-end. Used Django and Python to handle HTTP requests and responses. Built relational and MySQL databases to record all data about restaurants, users and events. Captured real location information and created events on the map with Google map API.  Deployed server side to Amazon EC2 which is able to handle 150 queries per second tested by Apache JMeter.
